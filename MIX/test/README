##  - MixTest -  ##

notes: mix_0.pl has to be in your path

usage: MixTest.pl <options> [test test2]

options: <none>    ->   run Tests with all kind of input (with diff)
	 -csv      ->   run only csv-input Tests (with diff)
	 -sxc      ->   run only sxc-input Tests (with diff)
	 -xls      ->   run only xls-input Tests (with diff)
	 -purge    ->   remove *.diff and mix_0.pl.out files
	 -update   ->   don't expect diff-sheets, generate new ones
     -import   ->   create test hierachy
     -export   ->   make test hierachy ready for export (includes -purge)
 
If no test name is given, runs all tests.
If no input format is specified with the -csv/-sxc/-xls switch, all three
formats will be tested.
