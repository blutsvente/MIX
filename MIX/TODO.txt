TODOs:
- Accept %::COL% in :name and ::inst columns
  early expansion required!
  wig20030124

- OPEN wires to external
  wig20030124

- Open files, delay close until EOF processing

- Check if the a object (Workbook) is opened from different path, but with
  same name?
  wig20030100
  
- Use / as file name seperator, convert to other format ( \ ) on demand (wig20021219)

- Add generator comment line to all output:
    -- timestamp
    -- hostname
    -- timestamp and location of all input data
    -- arguments


- Fold/Condense multiple entries (e.g. comments, ::in, ::out)

- Concatenate busses (e.g. if bits are defined).

- Implement extended range definitions for generator like:
    $i (1,7,13..15 )
  requested by sb20030117

- Implement second run parameter $j for generator like:
    $j (1..17), $i (1,3,5,20), /blablubber/
    requested by sb20030117

- Defaults for connections:
    bit -> std_ulogic (done)
    bus/vector -> std_ulogic_vector (if type empty and low and high defined)
    generic -> integer

    req. sb20030117

- ::variants: Default eq. "", if -variant VAR select Default + VAR.
  ::variants := VAR1,VAR2,Default
  ::variants := ""

- iN_foo N := 1.. number of instances of entity foo.

- separate interconnect sheets for each intermediate hierachy (in addition to flat interconnect sheet) 


DONE:

    - Make sure "0" is not going to become "<spc>" (wig20021219)
    fixed in MixUtils, 20030110

     - Keep already open files open after end
     impl. 20030113

    - Add signal width for busses before outputing ... (if width is defined for bus and in/out has >none<)
    fixed in MixParser, wig20030113
