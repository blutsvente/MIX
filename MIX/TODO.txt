TODOs:

- 20030221c: Add command args line to all output files ...
   1. intermediate: ::comment ??
     Done wig20030221
   2. output: add to header.
     Done wig20030221

- 20030221a:
    Read configuration options from "CONF" sheet
    | MIXCFG | key | value |
    keys are
       generate.output.arch leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.conf leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.enty leaf|noleaf
       .... (only existing keys in EH may be overridden) ....
   Read file in current dir "mix.cfg"
   
  option: -conf KEY=VAL
  option: -listconf  -> print out list of configuration keys

  Order: builtin < mix.cfg < CONF < command line

Done wig20030221

- 20030221b: add option: -sheet CONN="CONN_PERLRE", -sheet HIER="HIER_PERLRE" ...

  Done wig20030221


- 20030220i: Rewrite writers:
    -- Output into hash %outfiles{FILENAME}
    -- Fix DOS/UNIX CR issue

- 20030220j: Use Bugzilla for issues 

- 20030220k: Format ExCEL intermediate (column layout, page breaks ...), color, ....

- Accept %::COL% in :name and ::inst columns
  early expansion required!
  wig20030124

- OPEN wires to external
  wig20030124

- Open files, delay close until EOF processing

- Check if the a object (Workbook) is opened from different path, but with
  same name?
  wig20030100
  
- Use / as file name seperator, convert to other format ( \ ) on demand (wig20021219)

- Add generator comment line to all output:
    -- timestamp
    -- hostname
    -- timestamp and location of all input data
    -- arguments


- Fold/Condense multiple entries (e.g. comments, ::in, ::out)

- Concatenate busses (e.g. if bits are defined).

- Implement extended range definitions for generator like:
    $i (1,7,13..15 )
  requested by sb20030117

- Implement second run parameter $j for generator like:
    $j (1..17), $i (1,3,5,20), /blablubber/
    requested by sb20030117

- Defaults for connections:
    bit -> std_ulogic (done)
    bus/vector -> std_ulogic_vector (if type empty and low and high defined)
    generic -> integer

    req. sb20030117

- ::variants: Default eq. "", if -variant VAR select Default + VAR.
  ::variants := VAR1,VAR2,Default
  ::variants := ""

- iN_foo N := 1.. number of instances of entity foo.

- separate interconnect sheets for each intermediate hierachy (in addition to flat interconnect sheet) 

- 20030220a: Add ::architecture column, which defines the architecture name
  Default: RTL
  Requested by St. Bartels

- 20030220b: Check: RTL architecture must be unique
  Requested by ST. Bartels
  
- 20030220c: lower case everything!
  -- global configuration variable: lc := force|check|no
  -- implement checker: see if cases sensitvitiy creates conflicts, report!
  -- if force mode -> collaps conflicts
  
  Possibly inform if a name is not unique
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220d: Change EOL for -a, -e, -c files (MS-Win vs. UNIX)
  Workaround: Use script (recode)
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220e: Documentation + Application Note
  Application note:
        non-leaf cells multiple instantiation, how-to: global signal names localization
        
- 20030220f: Port<->Signal assignment depends on IN vs. OUT

- 20030220g: Add <CR> into ::in and ::out cells, recognize in inout
   done/wig20030220, rel. 1.7 MixUtils
   Issue: late insertion not really handeled by regular "parse_macro"

- 20030220h: Bug section:
    			p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi	: in	std_ulogic_vector(6); -- __W_SINGLEBITBUS
    should read as:
                    p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi : in std_ulogic; -- __I_SINGLEBITREDUCED


DONE:

    - Make sure "0" is not going to become "<spc>" (wig20021219)
    fixed in MixUtils, 20030110

     - Keep already open files open after end
     impl. 20030113

    - Add signal width for busses before outputing ... (if width is defined for bus and in/out has >none<)
    fixed in MixParser, wig20030113
