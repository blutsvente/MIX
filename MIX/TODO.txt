TODOs:

- 20030317a/Bug: Missing Port in component
    sbist_fail_ fehlt an ifu_top (kommt aus ga, Pin8, 9)
    Req: pallas
    Prio: high

- 20030313g/Bug: Improve Load/Driver evaluation
   If port width ne signal width, count "bit"wise. Save instead of integers
   into the AEPORT data structure. Add MIN,MAX,ALL fields.
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030313f/Feature: ExCEL chart diff (might be duplicate)
    Create "DELTA" chart, stringfy input and run through "Text::diff"
    Nameing: D_CONN, D_CONF, D_HIER, ...
    
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030313e/Bug: Allow "constant" assignments on bus splices
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium
    
- 20030313d/Bug: Do bus/bit/port handling in signal assigments, not in port maps!
    Req: pallas
    Prio: High
    Comment: Actually this seems not to be necessary.

- 20030313c/Feature: Detect generated port in a row and combine (might be
    done best on the intermediate data?)
    Req: wig
    Prio. Medium
    
- 20030313b/Bug: Cannot rename new spreadsheet to BLA-mixed.xls, if BLA-mixed
  already open in other directory. Check that and report usefull error message.
    Req: wig
    Prio: low
    

- 20030312a/Check: Find "open" input ports and report
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030311e/Bug: Reenable ExCEL warnings after MIX run (otherwise you will never
    see warnings again and might loose work).
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030311d/Check: Complain about unrestricted busses ( ..._vector missing High/Low).
    Req: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030311c/Feature: How to handle I/O ? What to do with signals not connected to
  leaf blocks? Missing drivers? Missing loads?

  per entitiy (command line switch)
    Req: wig
    Prio: low


- 20030228a/Feature: Write out evaluated contents of mix.cfg (and timestamp) and
   command line switches and %EH to CONF sheet!
   Reason: can be reevaluated on backend side, catch differences
   
   Req: wig
   Prio: medium
   
- 20030227b: Check if signal ends in an intermediate hierachy
    Requested: wig

    Write out ENTY-e.vhd.N if a entity gets instantiated several times
    Requested: wig
    Prio: low

- 20030226d: wiring still does not work as expected:
      port maps and entitiy may have name only once.
      combination has to be done in signal assignment


- bug/20030226b: check nreset signal

  
- 20030224a: Accept strings in (F:T) of ::in and ::out descriptions

    -- Fix DOS/UNIX CR issue

- 20030220j: Use Bugzilla for issues 


- Accept %::COL% in :name and ::inst columns
  early expansion required!
  wig20030124

- OPEN wires to external
  wig20030124

- Open files, delay close until EOF processing

- Check if the a object (Workbook) is opened from different path, but with

  wig20030100
  
- Use / as file name seperator, convert to other format ( \ ) on demand (wig20021219)


- Fold/Condense multiple entries (e.g. comments, ::in, ::out)

- Concatenate busses (e.g. if bits are defined).

- Implement second run parameter $j for generator like:
    $j (1..17), $i (1,3,5,20), /blablubber/
    requested by sb20030117

- Defaults for connections:
    bit -> std_ulogic (done)

- 20030220b: Check: RTL architecture must be unique
  Requested by ST. Bartels

  -- if force mode -> collaps conflicts
  
  Possibly inform if a name is not unique
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220d: Change EOL for -a, -e, -c files (MS-Win vs. UNIX)
  Workaround: Use script (recode)
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220e: Documentation + Application Note
  Application note:
        non-leaf cells multiple instantiation, how-to: global signal names localization
        
- 20030220f: Port<->Signal assignment depends on IN vs. OUT

- 20030220g: Add <CR> into ::in and ::out cells, recognize in inout
   done/wig20030220, rel. 1.7 MixUtils
   Issue: late insertion not really handeled by regular "parse_macro"


- 20030220h: Bug section:
    			p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi	: in	std_ulogic_vector(6); -- __W_SINGLEBITBUS
    should read as:
                    p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi : in std_ulogic; -- __I_SINGLEBITREDUCED

    Req: mpallas
    Prio: medium (workaround: manual edit)
    Testcase: bitsplice / CONN / TestMDE_1 (wig20030312)
    

DONE:

- 20030227a: File name generation:
      ENTY-e.vhd
      ENTY-ARCH-a.vhd
      ENTY-ARCH-CONF-c.vhd
          (whole name equals ::conf column, but _ -> -)
      
    Requested: wig
    Prio: medium
    Done: 20030317

- Add generator comment line to all output:
    -- timestamp
    -- hostname
    -- timestamp and location of all input data
    -- arguments


- 20030228b/Feature:
    Delta mode: Generate Delta to previous output (diff)
        - intermediate
        - backend
    Minimum: Indicate if previous output was the same

    Use: Algorithm::Diff, Text::Diff
    Req: wig
    Prio: low
    Done: 20030317, wig

- 20030313a/Bug: MDE-B_TL.xls gets closed after parsing. Should stay open!
    Req: wig
    Prio: low
    Done: wig (reason: case of filename, use lowercase now)

- 20030312b/Feature: Add user specific configuration file (use home directory)
    Req: wig
    Prio: low
    Done: 20030317wig
        Look for mix.cfg in the following locations:
        ENV{HOME} aka 'HOMEDRIVE' . 'HOMEPATH' or 'USERPROFILE' or 'C:\'
        ENV{PROJECT}
        Order: HOME / HOME / cwd() / -conf (last wins)

- 20030221a:
    Read configuration options from "CONF" sheet
    | MIXCFG | key | value |
    keys are
       generate.output.arch leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.conf leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.enty leaf|noleaf
       .... (only existing keys in EH may be overridden) ....
   Read file in current dir "mix.cfg"
   See also: 20030312b
   
  option: -conf KEY=VAL
  option: -listconf  -> print out list of configuration keys

  Order: builtin < mix.cfg < CONF < command line

Done wig20030221

- 20030220k: Format ExCEL intermediate (column layout, page breaks ...), color, ....
  Priority: low (see 20030226c)
  Comment: ExCEL intermediate keeps format from previous runs, now.

- 20030221b: add option: -sheet CONN="CONN_PERLRE", -sheet HIER="HIER_PERLRE" ...

  Done wig20030221


- 20030220a: Add ::architecture column, which defines the architecture name
  Default: RTL
  Requested by St. Bartels
  Done: wig
  Testcase: any


- 20030226a: Do not add configuration for verilog instances
  by: Michael Pallas
  done: wig 20030227
  testcase: sigport.xls/HIER_VERI


- 20030226e: add column for library use:
    e.g.: ::use
    will be added to entity definition and possibly to arch and conf
    syntax:
        ALL:NAME.component,ENTY:NAMEB.component,ARCH:NAMEC,
        CONF:NAMED,NAMEE

    the ALL|ENTY|ARCH|CONF keyword selects into which files the use
    statement gets generated. Default is "ENTY".
    Capitalization does not matter.
    ->

    library NAME;
    use NAME.component.ALL;

    req: Michael Pallas   
    done: wig20030227
    test case: sigport.xls/HIER_USE

  done 20030226
  

    - Make sure "0" is not going to become "<spc>" (wig20021219)
    fixed in MixUtils, 20030110

     - Keep already open files open after end
     impl. 20030113
