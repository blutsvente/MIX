Major: IO sheet processing!!

Doku:
    App Note:
        Describe macro usage
        Describe generator usage
        Describe use
        Describe command line switches
        Describe mix.cfg
        Describe CONF sheet

Hint: Use "recode pc..lat1 *.vhd" for easy and fast DOS2UNIX converter

TODOs:
- 20030228d/Feature: generate hierachical sheets
    Req: Claus
    Prio: Low

- 20030228c/Feature: write arch, conf and entity into one file
  per entitiy (command line switch)
    Req: wig
    Prio: low

- 20030228b/Feature:
    Delta mode: Generate Delta to previous output (diff)
        - intermediate
        - backend
    Minimum: Indicate if previous output was the same

    Use: Algorithm::Diff, Text::Diff
    Req: wig
    Prio: low


- 20030228a/Feature: Write out evaluated contents of mix.cfg (and timestamp) and
   command line switches and %EH to CONF sheet!
   Reason: can be reevaluated on backend side, catch differences
   
   Req: wig
   Prio: medium
   
- 20030227b: Check if signal ends in an intermediate hierachy
    Requested: wig
    Prio: medium
    
- 20030227a: File name generation:
      ENTY-e.vhd
      ENTY-ARCH-a.vhd
      ENTY-ARCH-CONF-c.vhd
          (whole name equals ::conf column, but _ -> -)
      
    Requested: wig
    Prio: medium

- 20030227b: 
    Write out ENTY-e.vhd.N if a entity gets instantiated several times
    Requested: wig
    Prio: low

- 20030226d: wiring still does not work as expected:
      port maps and entitiy may have name only once.
      combination has to be done in signal assignment


- bug/20030226b: check nreset signal

  
- 20030224a: Accept strings in (F:T) of ::in and ::out descriptions
  (string should be generic or constant)

  - 20030221d: Accept strings as high/low bus bounds.
  wig
 
- 20030221c: Add command args line to all output files ...
   1. intermediate: ::comment ??
     Done wig20030221
   2. output: add to header.
     Done wig20030221


- 20030220i: Rewrite writers:
    -- Output into hash %outfiles{FILENAME}
    -- Fix DOS/UNIX CR issue

- 20030220j: Use Bugzilla for issues 

- 20030220k: Format ExCEL intermediate (column layout, page breaks ...), color, ....
  Priority: low (see 20030226c)
  
- Accept %::COL% in :name and ::inst columns
  early expansion required!
  wig20030124

- OPEN wires to external
  wig20030124

- Open files, delay close until EOF processing

- Check if the a object (Workbook) is opened from different path, but with
  same name?
  wig20030100
  
- Use / as file name seperator, convert to other format ( \ ) on demand (wig20021219)

- Add generator comment line to all output:
    -- timestamp
    -- hostname
    -- timestamp and location of all input data
    -- arguments


- Fold/Condense multiple entries (e.g. comments, ::in, ::out)

- Concatenate busses (e.g. if bits are defined).

- Implement extended range definitions for generator like:
    $i (1,7,13..15 )
  requested by sb20030117

- Implement second run parameter $j for generator like:
    $j (1..17), $i (1,3,5,20), /blablubber/
    requested by sb20030117

- Defaults for connections:
    bit -> std_ulogic (done)
    bus/vector -> std_ulogic_vector (if type empty and low and high defined)
    generic -> integer

    req. sb20030117

- ::variants: Default eq. "", if -variant VAR select Default + VAR.
  ::variants := VAR1,VAR2,Default
  ::variants := ""

- iN_foo N := 1.. number of instances of entity foo.

- output separate interconnect sheets for each intermediate hierachy (in addition to flat interconnect sheet) 

- 20030220b: Check: RTL architecture must be unique
  Requested by ST. Bartels
  
- 20030220c: lower case everything!
  -- global configuration variable: lc := force|check|no
  -- implement checker: see if cases sensitvitiy creates conflicts, report!
  -- if force mode -> collaps conflicts
  
  Possibly inform if a name is not unique
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220d: Change EOL for -a, -e, -c files (MS-Win vs. UNIX)
  Workaround: Use script (recode)
  Requested by M. Pallas

- 20030220e: Documentation + Application Note
  Application note:
        non-leaf cells multiple instantiation, how-to: global signal names localization
        
- 20030220f: Port<->Signal assignment depends on IN vs. OUT

- 20030220g: Add <CR> into ::in and ::out cells, recognize in inout
   done/wig20030220, rel. 1.7 MixUtils
   Issue: late insertion not really handeled by regular "parse_macro"


- 20030220h: Bug section:
    			p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi	: in	std_ulogic_vector(6); -- __W_SINGLEBITBUS
    should read as:
                    p_mix_cp_lcmd_6_6_gi : in std_ulogic; -- __I_SINGLEBITREDUCED


DONE:

- 20030221a:
    Read configuration options from "CONF" sheet
    | MIXCFG | key | value |
    keys are
       generate.output.arch leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.conf leaf|noleaf
       generate.output.enty leaf|noleaf
       .... (only existing keys in EH may be overridden) ....
   Read file in current dir "mix.cfg"
   
  option: -conf KEY=VAL
  option: -listconf  -> print out list of configuration keys

  Order: builtin < mix.cfg < CONF < command line

Done wig20030221

- 20030221b: add option: -sheet CONN="CONN_PERLRE", -sheet HIER="HIER_PERLRE" ...

  Done wig20030221


- 20030220a: Add ::architecture column, which defines the architecture name
  Default: RTL
  Requested by St. Bartels
  Done: wig
  Testcase: any


- 20030226a: Do not add configuration for verilog instances
  by: Michael Pallas
  done: wig 20030227
  testcase: sigport.xls/HIER_VERI


- 20030226e: add column for library use:
    e.g.: ::use
    will be added to entity definition and possibly to arch and conf
    syntax:
        ALL:NAME.component,ENTY:NAMEB.component,ARCH:NAMEC,
        CONF:NAMED,NAMEE

    the ALL|ENTY|ARCH|CONF keyword selects into which files the use
    statement gets generated. Default is "ENTY".
    Capitalization does not matter.
    ->

    library NAME;
    use NAME.component.ALL;

    req: Michael Pallas   
    done: wig20030227
    test case: sigport.xls/HIER_USE
    

- 20030226c: Keep ExCEL output format in -mixed.xls if possible.
  wig
  done 20030226
  

    - Make sure "0" is not going to become "<spc>" (wig20021219)
    fixed in MixUtils, 20030110

     - Keep already open files open after end
     impl. 20030113

    - Add signal width for busses before outputing ... (if width is defined for bus and in/out has >none<)
    fixed in MixParser, wig20030113
