>>title: MIX/Release 20060411: updated xls2csv, imporved logging and configuration

xls2csv update:

Now supports the selection of rows and/or columns (see -column / -row option)


    Options:
	-[no]csv      Don/t generate CSV formatter file (on by default)
	-[no]sxc      Don/t generate sxc formatted output file (on by default)
	-autoq[uote]  Do quoting the ExCEL style
	-q[uote] X    Use X as quoting char (default: ")
	-sep X        Use X as column seperator (default: ;)
	-noquote      Do not quote the output
	-sheet RE     Select only sheets matching the RE
	-[no]single   Write each sheet into a seperate output csv; extend name by sheet name.
                  Default is to write a single csv and/or sxc file per input excel file with
                  seperating the sheets by the sheet header (see -[no]head). With -single
                  no sheet seperator head will be printed.
	-[no]accu[mulate] Combine all excel files into a sinlge output csv or sxc file.
                  Default is to convert a single csv and/or sxc file per input excel file.
                  Basename is taken from the first excel file name. 
	-[no]head     Do not print sheet seperator head (\"=:=:=:=> SHEETNAME\" by default)
	-[no]verbose  Print more messages
	
	-column|(c)range A:B,C   select columns (by EXCEL numbering or digit)
	-row|rrange N:M		select rows
	-matchc \"REG_matching header\"
	-matchr \"RE_matching first cell contents in row\"
	Possible ranges are:   A..C,EE-FA,G:I,14,16-70,II-
			(alpha only for column headers)
			Repeated options are ORed (tried one after the other)
			If column or row selector options are set, only matching data will be printed


Example:

$ xls2csv -csv -single -sheet my_data -autoq -nohead my_excel.xls

will retrieve the sheet "my_data" from the excel document my_excel.xls and store it's content
in the file my_excel--my_data.csv in a format very, very near the one you would get when using
"Save As" in ExCEL and store the worksheet in CSV format.

$ xls2csv -csv -row 1-10,1-10 -single my_excel.xls

will print the first ten rows two times into the csv file(s) my_excel--<sheet names>.csv
of each sheet in the excel document.

Please consider, that overlapping selections will print the data selected multiple time.
xls2csv will sort the selectors in numeric start order.


>>title: release_20060411 mix/1.5

I have released mix/1.5 for public use now. As there are still some highly wanted features
in the todo list, there might be some patches, though.

UNIX:

$ module load mix/1.5

Windows:
K:\PROJECTS\MIX\1.5\mix_0.pl

Major new features:

1. verilog modules can be mapped for testing purposes.

Example:
`ifdef exclude_module_1   // instantiate dummy module 
	assign sig1_s = 1'b0;
	assign sign_s = 1'b0;
`else
	module_1 (
		   .sig1_o (sig1_s);
		   .sign_o (sign_s)
		   );
`endif

The module mapping is controlled by the config key

	output.generate.verilog.verimap.*


	# Enable the default wrapper: fixed values:
	MIXCFG output.generate.verimap.modules	ALL
	MIXCFG output.generate.verimap.sigvalue sig_08=1,inst_a[ab]/sig_0.?=some_val,0

	ALL is an other way of saying ".*"

	Modules and sigvalue take a comma or whitespace seperated list of perl regular expressions.
	
	modules:
		If a module name matches one of the re's from modules, this module will be mapped. "ALL" is another
		way of saying ".*".
	sigvalue:
		Specify the to be assigned value in the from "inst_re/signal_re=value" or "signal_re=value" or "value".
		Default is "0". In case the value is "1" or "0", it will be automatically extended to W'b1(xW) to match
		the width of busses. All other values will be used literally.

This function is very limited currently, please report problems (e.g. it will not cope well with partial bus assignments and multiply
connected signals).

2. Completely reworked the logging. Please expect some rough edges (and also that the output is even more verbose then before).
In case you don't like it, currently you can create your own "mixlog.conf" (see /tools/mix/1.5 for a template). A future release will
have some extensions to better controll the output in an easier fashion.

3. Many tiny fixes …., will be announced when the final 1.5 gets rolled out.
