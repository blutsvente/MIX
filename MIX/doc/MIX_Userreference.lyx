Introduction
\layout Standard

MIX is part of the registermaster tools.
 The registermaster set is comprised of a method and a tool to automatically
 derive top-level hardware description, low-level driver software and documentat
ion out of a single source structural specification is presented.
 In contrast to system-level design tools this approach focuses on structural
 properties like interconnect, hierarchy and control/status registers instead
 of refining a functional specification.
 A table-based specification format was chosen to enable efficient data
 entry and review.
 Due to automatic code generation consistency between specification and
 design is guaranteed and error-prone manual transformations can be avoided.
 This paper focuses on specification and hardware generation.
\layout Section

Management Summary
\layout Standard

MIX is a simple to use script, which creates all of a chip top level source
 files from a single input file.
 This input file is the single source description of hierachy, connectivity,
 IO wiring and internal control busses like I2C.

Installation
\layout Standard

The MIX toolset uses the Perl scripting language.
 Please install a recent version of Perl on your MS-Windows workstation,
 e.g.
 the freely available ActiveState Perl from

MICRONAS
\end_inset 

.
 Alternatively you can use the cygwin environment.
 Check the software installation hints at the end of this document.
\newline 
Start MIX from the network drive like described in the examples below.
 That will also make sure, that you are using the most recent release automatica
lly.
 After the Perl installation, you can immediately start MIX:
\layout Standard

- Open a command shell on your desktop workstation:
\layout Standard

- Press 
\family typewriter 
Start -> Run
\family default 
 ; type 
\family typewriter 
cmd
\layout Standard

- Now change to your working directory and start the generator like

\layout Section

Getting Started
\layout Standard

To receive useful results, MIX reads in various input date from spreadsheets,
 typically stored in ExCEL workbooks.
 At least you will need to prepare a description of your design hierarchy
 (
\series bold 
HIER
\series default 
) and the connectivity sheet (
\series bold 
CONN
\series default 
).
 If found, MIX will convert a input/output sheet 
\series bold 
IO
\series default 
, listing input/output pads and iocells and how these are linked to the
 core logic into appropriate hierarchy and connection lists.
 The 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
I2C
\family default 
\series default 
 sheet can be used to describe an on-chip I2C bus and it's configuration.
\layout Subsection

A simple example
\layout Standard

To understand the usage of the various tables and options, a very simple
 example is shown and extended step by step.
 The simple example just has two components 
\emph on 
a
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
b
\emph default 
, which are connected by the signal 
\emph on 
sigfoo
\emph default 
.
 The two instances have a common parent 
\emph on 
chip
\emph default 
.

\newline 
 Image 1: mix_simple.xls
\newline 

\newline 
The equivalent description of this simple design in MIX is made up from
 a worksheet 
\series bold 
HIER
\series default 
.
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/mix_simple_1.jpg
	lyxscale 80
	scale 80
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
The first row defines the table headers names.
 The names have to be in the form "
\family typewriter 
::NAME
\family default 
".
 Several of the columns are required, some are optional and you can define
 additional columns on your own.
 For 
\family typewriter 
HIER
\family default 
 sheets the "
\family typewriter 
::inst
\family default 
" column is the primary key.
 One design element will be generated for each new name of an 
\family typewriter 
::inst
\family default 
 row.
 If a name is defined several times, these lines will be overloaded or summarize
d, depending on built-in rules of the MIX converter.
\newline 
The first column of all sheets has to be "
\family typewriter 
::ign
\family default 
".
 If it starts with a #, the rest of this row will be ignored.
 All other columns can be added in arbitrary order.
\newline 

\newline 
The second required worksheet is 
\series bold 
CONN
\series default 
:
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/mix_simple_2.jpg
	lyxscale 80
	scale 80
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
 As you see, this worksheet also starts with the table header definition
 line.
 The primary field is the "::name" column.
 The "::in" and "::out" columns are used to define the drivers and loads
 for the signals.
\layout Subsection

Mix it!
\layout Standard

Run the MIX converter tool in the directory the excel spreadsheet is stored
 in:
\newline 
MS-Windows:
\layout Standard

\family default 

\newline 
UNIX:
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
$ module load perl mix
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
$ mix foo.xls
\family default 

\newline 
This reads in the design description and evaluates the various sheets.
 It creates output files with an intermediate excel design description (
\family typewriter 
mix_simple-mixed.xls
\family default 
) and the same data in a internal format (
\family typewriter 
mix_simple.pld
\family default 
).
 A log file (
\family typewriter 
mix_0.pl.log
\family default 
) and the HDL output files are written in the same run.
 Image 2 shows a screenshot of the 
\family typewriter 
mix_simpe.xls
\family default 
 conversion.
 Only the most important errors and warnings are written to the screen,
 while a lot of information will be written to the log file.
 Search for the keywords "ERROR" and "WARNING" to verify proper conversion.

\newline 
 Image 2: mix_simple conversion
\newline 
All output files are stored in the current working directory.
 Old versions of the output files are overwritten.
 Except the log file that is appended by each converter run.
 The intermediate excel description file keeps a history of previous 
\family typewriter

\layout Subsubsection

You get what you typed
\layout Standard

MIX generates various HDL files defined by the input data.
 If you select VHDL (also the default language) as output description for
 a hierarchy element, each element results in an appropriate entity, architectur
e and configuration description.
 By default MIX writes one file for all entities, one for all architecture
 and one for all configuration descriptions.
 Those file names are derived from the last excel input file name by stripping
 of the .xls extension and attaching a -e.vhd, -a.vhd and -c.vhd.
\newline 
Here the working directory of the simple example contains a file mix.cfg,
 which is the convenient storage for MIX run-time configuration options.
 The lines "
\family typewriter 
MIXCFG outarch ARCH
\family default 
", "
\family typewriter 
MIXCFG outenty ENTY
\family default 
", and "
\family typewriter 
MIXCFG outconf CONF
\family default 
" switch MIX outputs to separate files for each entity, architecture and
 configuration.
 In this case the file names are defined by the element name:

By default MIX does not write output data for leaf blocks (instances which
 are not parent for other instances).
 Adding a line like "
\family typewriter 
MIXCFG generate.output.arch leaf
\family default 
" into the mix.cfg file changes that.
\newline 
The generated output files contain head, body and footer sections.
 See the screenshots of the file a-e-e.vhd and chip-e-rtl-a.vhd for examples
 of an entity and an architecture definition.

Initialization with -init
\layout Standard

You can use the 
\family typewriter 
-init
\family default 
 command line option to create the needed files:
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{20mm}
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
$ mix_0.pl -init foo.vhd bar.xls
\family default 

\newline 
will create the file 
\family typewriter 
bar.xls
\family default 
, which has the following three worksheet categories:
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{10mm}
\end_inset 

- empty HIER, CONN and IO sheets
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{10mm}
\end_inset 

- template sheets with numerous examples TMPL_(HIER|CONN|IO)
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{10mm}
\end_inset 

- import sheets IMP_HIER and IMP_CONN (only if *.vhd or 
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{11mm}
\end_inset 

 *.v files are given as command line arguments).
\newline 
You will also get a 
\family typewriter 
mix.cfg
\family default 
 file.
 If 
\family typewriter 
bar.xls
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
mix.cfg
\family default 
 already exists, the command will exit without changes.
 The import of 
\family typewriter 
*.vhd
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
*.v
\family default 
 files is experimental and meant to give a way of getting a start description
 of your design.
 In case of VHDL files, only entity descriptions are imported.
 Take care of getting signal names and instance names properly.
\layout Subsection

Common worksheet properties
\layout Standard

All worksheets parsed by MIX share some common properties.
 There needs to be a header line consisting only of keywords with leading
 double colon.
 All data before the header line is ignored.
 Only the first header line will be evaluated.
 Data in columns with no header or malformed headers will be ignored.
\newline 
Commonly understood table headings are 
\family typewriter 
::ign
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
::comment
\family default 
.
 The 
\family typewriter 
::ign
\family default 
 column is special, because it needs to be the first column of a sheet.
 If a cell in the 
\family typewriter 
::ign
\family default 
 column starts with a 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
#
\family default 
 or a 
\family typewriter 
//
\family default 
, the complete row is ignored.The 
\family typewriter 
::comment
\family default 
 column can contain user or program generated comments for a given row.
 It's data will be appended to it's contents as it appears.
\newline 
MIX reads the cell values.
 This is, for Excel and Star(/Open)-Office, what you see , not the real
 contents of the cells.
 Thus all formulas can be used to define the cell values (note: csv is not
 able to do that).
\newline 
A lot of predefined text macros are understood and converted by MIX.
 A text macro is made up by a name surrounded by 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
%
\family default 
 signs.
 Retrieve a complete list of macros with the -listconf command line switch
 and grep all lines starting with "
\family typewriter 
MIXCFG macro
\family default 
".
 The table 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
%macro
\backslash 
%
\family default 
 gives a list of predefined macros, their default settings and wether this
 macro can be used by the user.
 You can use text macros inside of any cell.
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/mix_table0.jpg
	lyxscale 60
	scale 60
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
 A second type of macros are available to reference other columns of a like
 through 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
%::NAME
\backslash 
%
\family default 
.
 This will be replaced by the contents of the 
\family typewriter 
::NAME
\family default 
 column of this row.
 
\family typewriter 
::NAME
\family default 
 has to be defined for the current worksheet, obviously.
 In the above example 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
%::inst
\backslash 
%_e
\family default 
 will evaluate to 
\family typewriter 
chip_e
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
a_e
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
b_e
\family default 
 accordingly.
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
%LANGUAGE
\backslash 
%
\family default 
 becomes vhdl.
 Macro expansion happens just before the intermediate design data is written
 out, after evaluation of all input data.
 Recursive macro expansion is not implemented.
 Macros in primary keys like signal and instance names are evaluated at
 signal or instance creation time.
\layout Subsection

Special Spreadsheet-format properties
\layout Standard

MIX is able to read three different table formats: csv(Comma-Seperated-Values),
 sxc(Star-Office-Spreadsheet) and xls(Excel-Spreadsheet).
 While Excel and StarOffice Spreadsheets are full featured, the csv Format
 does not understand formulas.
 This is because the real content and it's values are same in csv.
 The only colored output can(at this moment) be achieved by writing Excel-Spread
sheets(for this an already installed Excel is needed).
 While writing Excel-sheets implies Windows, reading input can be done on
 every Platform(if it got a Perl port).
 Trying to read a Excel-Sheet on non-Windows grounds will cause MIX to produce
 csv per default.
 The output format can be forced by setting 
\family typewriter 
format.out
\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 
csv
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
sxc
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
xls
\family default 
.
 In this case MIX will read the given input file and produce the forced
 output format.
\layout Subsection

HIER sheet properties
\layout Standard

The hierarchy of a design is defined in the HIER sheet.
 By default the HIER sheet is named HIER, but you can set the configuration
 value 
\series bold 
hier.xls
\series default 
 to a Perl regular expression.
 MIX will then consider all worksheets which names match the perl regular
 expression, to be HIER definitions.
 In that case you are free to use different header definitions on different
 sheets.
\newline 
The HIER sheets require at least the columns marked man.
 (mandatory) in the following table.

::udc: Adding user defined code
\layout Standard

Since the release from July 2005, the MIX template provides several new

% and %VERILOG_HOOK_BODY% can be set to an arbitrary string.
 They will be overloaded by the instance specific ::udc text, if that is
 defined in the HIER sheet.
 The 
\emph on 
::udc
\emph default 
 cell contents will be split into several parts by markers like 
\emph on 
/%LOCATION%/

Automatic Generation of Toplevel Ports
\layout Standard

If the signal mode as defined in the 
\family typewriter 
::mode
\family default 
 column matches one of I, O or IO, MIX will create top level ports.
 This feature can be disabled by the configuration variable 
\family typewriter 
output.generate.inout
\family default 
.
 Possible values are 
\family typewriter 
mode
\family default 
(enable top level port generation) and 
\family typewriter 
noxfix
\family default 
(do not prefix and postfix generated port names for top level ports), which
 are set by default.
 To exclude some signals from automatic top-level port generation, use 
\family typewriter 
output.generate.xinout sig_foo,sig_bar
\family default 
.
 This feature is usefull if you need to use internal inout signals, but
 do not want to have them wired to the top-level.

\newline 

\layout Subsubsection

%OPEN% aka.
 open
\layout Standard

Use the 
\family typewriter 
%OPEN%
\family default 
 signal to leave some pins of module bar port a open.
 MIX has no knowledge about ports.
 Everything is defined in terms of signals and instances.
 Use the "
\family typewriter 
open
\family default 
" pseudo signal to define the extra pins.
\newline 

\newline 
E.g.: wire 
\family typewriter 
foo/a
\family default 
 port to 
\family typewriter 
bar/a
\family default 
 port.
 
\family typewriter 
bar/a
\family default 
 should have some extra pins.
\newline 

\newline 

\family typewriter 
\size small 
::name signal_a, ::high 7, ::low 0, ::out foo/a ::in bar/a
\newline 
::name %OPEN%, ::high 1, ::low 0, ::in -, ::out bar/a(9:8)
\family default 
\size default 

\newline 
 
\newline 
This will yield a port 
\family typewriter 
a
\family default

\family typewriter

 The two higher bits will be left open.
\layout Standard

Constants
\layout Standard

Constant values can be defined and used in several ways in the CONN worksheet.
 Constants can be marked with a C in the 
\family typewriter 
::mode
\family default 
 column.
 Basically anything resembling a number written in the 
\family typewriter 
::out
\family default 
 column will be considered to be a constant value.
 String and bit vector constants are enclosed in single or double quotes.
 Remember to type two single quotes in excel to start a single quote string.
 Excel takes the first quote character to prevent the following string to
 be interpolated by excel.
\newline 
If you do not name a constant (leave the 
\family typewriter 
::name
\family default 
 field empty), MIX will generate a name like 
\family typewriter 
mix_const_N
\family default 
.
 N starts by one and increments for each new constant value.
\newline 
Constant values can be assigned to instance ports in the 
\family typewriter 
::in
\family default 
 column of that constant.
 
\newline 
Depending on the form of a constant and the output language, MIX tries to
 convert the constant value into something suitable.
 See the constant.xls example (XXXLINK).

 in the comments to detect constants MIX was not able to translate properly.
 Verilog constant output is not very mature as of today.

Generics and Parameters
\layout Standard

Generics for entities are defined by a 
\series bold 
G
\series default 
 in the 
\family typewriter 
::mode
\family default 
 column.
 The 
\family typewriter 
::name
\family default 
 column defines the generics name.
 If the 
\family typewriter 
::out
\family default 
 column contains a string or a number, the value will be the default of
 this generic.
\newline 
A 
\series bold 
P
\series default 
 in the 
\family typewriter 
::mode
\family default 
 column marks parameters.
 The value given in the 
\family typewriter 
::out
\family default 
 column will be applied to the instances in the 
\family typewriter 
::in
\family default 
 column.
\newline 
If the 
\family typewriter 
::name
\family default 
 column is empty, MIX will assign a generated name.
 The HDL generic name is either the "port" name given in the 
\family typewriter 
::in
\family default 
 column or the 
\family typewriter 
::name
\family default 
.
\newline 
A example description taken from a CONN sheet will create the following
 output in VHDL:

Simple text macros
\layout Standard

Text marked with with a % on both sides is subject to be replaced, if a
 macro or a postfix of that name is defined.
 See the table of predefined macros.
 Additionally the contents of the input table can be referenced like %::column_h
ead%.
 If no suitable text macro is found, the text will be left as is.
\newline 
The text macro replacement does not operate recursively in general.
\newline 

\newline 
Please consider that some text macros are used internally and some have
 a special meaning, too.
 E.g.
 the pseudo signals %OPEN% and %LOW_BUS%.

Predefined and user macros
\layout Standard

The following table (XXXwhere is the listXXX) contains a list of predefined

 Some of them are defined at run time (e.g.
 the current date), some are for internal purposes only.
 macros marked with a yes in the "User" column can be set freely by the
 user on the command line or in the

output.generate.verimap.modules: Mapping verilog modules for testing purposes.
\layout Standard

When the 
\family typewriter 
output.generate.verimap.modules
\family default 
 paramter is set to a perl regular expression, MIX will create an ifdef
 wrapper around verilog modules instantiations matching the expression.
\layout Standard

Example:
\newline 

\family typewriter 
\size footnotesize 
`ifdef exclude_module_1
\newline 
// instantiate dummy module
\newline 
assign sig1_s = 1'b0;
\newline 
assign sign_s = 1'b0;
\newline 
`else
\newline 
module_1 ( .sig1_o (sig1_s); .sign_o (sign_s) );
\newline 
`endif 
\layout Standard

The module mapping is controlled by the config keys output.generate.verilog.verimap.
*
\newline 

\family typewriter 
# Enable the default wrapper: fixed values:
\newline 
MIXCFG output.generate.verimap.modules ALL
\newline 
MIXCFG output.generate.verimap.sigvalue sig_08=1,inst_a[ab]/sig_0.?=some_val,0
\family default 

\newline 
ALL is an other way of saying ".*".
\layout Standard

modules and sigvalue take a comma or whitespace seperated list of perl regular
 expressions.
 modules: If a module name matches one of the re's from modules, this module
 will be mapped.
 "ALL" is another way of saying ".*".
\newline 
sigvalue: Specify the value to be assigned to in the from of "
\family typewriter 
inst_re/signal_re=value
\family default 
" or "
\family typewriter 
signal_re=value
\family default 
" or "
\family typewriter 
value
\family default 
".
 Default is "
\family typewriter 
0
\family default 
".
 In case the value is "1" or "0", it will be automatically extended to W'b1(xW)
 to match the width of busses.
 All other values will be used literally.
 
\layout Standard

This function is very limited currently, please report problems.
 E.g.
 it will not cope well with partial bus assignments and signals connected
 more then once.
 VHDL output ist not supported.
 This parameter was added with the availabity of mix/1.5 (20060411).

\family default 
 parameter is set to a perl regular expression and/or a list of comma seperated
 modulenames, MIX will create an `ifdef wrapper around the verilog modules
 portmaps to provide configurable input insertion points.
 By default all input signals of applicable modules will be routed through
 multiplexers.

The following configuration parameters in the '
\family typewriter 
output.generate.emumux
\family default 
' namespace are available:
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'modules' Modules matching this regular expression are subject to emumux
 insertion.
 This parameter takes a list of comma seperated module names and/or perl
 regular expressions.
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'sigselect' Only signals matching this list or regex are muxed, if left
 empty it defaults to '.*' for input signals.
 See also the 'options' parameter
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'select' preset to 'emu_mux_%::inst%', MIX uses this value as mux select
 signal name.
 The name will be macro expanded.
 %::inst% is set to the current module name.
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'define' preset to 'insert_emu_mux_%::inst%', MIX uses this value as `define
 selector.
 The name will be macro expandend.
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'muxsnameo' preset to '%::name%_emux_s', naming for generated signal from
 mux to port.
 %::name% gets expanded to the current signal name by the macro expansion.
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'muxsnamei' preset to '%::name%_vc_s', naming for generated signal, insertion
 signal.
 Subject to macro expansion.
\layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

'options' defaults to 'in', defines extra (global) options like in | out
 | inout | leaf | nonleaf.
 MIX internal usage, only.
\layout Standard

An alternative way of inserting emulation multiplexer is by adding a column
 
\family typewriter 
::emumux
\family default 
 in the hierachy sheet.
 Each instance there with a non empty 
\family typewriter 
::emumux
\family default 
 cell will be subject to emulation multiplexer insertion, too.
 You can set all of the above listed options there in the format 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
key=value, key2=value
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 They will have precedence over the global options for this instance.
\layout Standard

The emumux expansion is available for verilog modules, only.
 Please be aware, that special cases of port and signal splicing might wired
 incorrectly.

CONN sheet macros
\layout Standard

To simplify the wiring of standard interfaces, MIX provides the connection
 macro facility.
 The connection macros are entered just like any other connection, but are
 marked by 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 in the 
\family typewriter 
::gen
\family default 
 column.
 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 is the macro header line, which has to be followed by one to many 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 macro definition row.
 The first non-comment line without a 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 tag stops the macro definition.
\newline 
The tag 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 marks lines subject to be macro expanded.
 The macro expansion takes place after the initial tables were parsed.
\newline 
You can define simple, one-letter variabes in the macro cells.
 Any text in 
\family typewriter 
::ign
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
::gen
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
::comment
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
::descr
\family default 
 cells of a 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 row will not be subject to matching and evaluation, but be ignored.
 Apart from that the column names have no special meaning.
\newline 

\newline 
A simple example will illustrate the connection macro usage.
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics

	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
 Here the macro header 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 defines the variables $n, $1, $h, $4 and $5.
 The MIX parser extracts the 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 row and accompanying 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 rows (five lines here) from the table.
 In a second parser run each 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 row will trigger a match operation against 
\emph on 
all
\emph default 
 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 definitions.
 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 are a match, if each cell defined in the 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 row has a matching counterpart in the 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 row.
 Variables in the 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 cells are considered to match any string ( .+ in perl regular expression
 syntax).
 Thus the first 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 line matches the 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 lines here.
 The variables defined in the 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 cells are assigned the matching values from the 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 line.
 E.g.
 $n will be 
\emph on 
0
\emph default 
 for the first 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
, 
\emph on 
1
\emph default 
 for the second.
 The variable $4 is assignd 
\emph on 
ls
\emph default 
, $5 becomes 
\emph on 
min
\emph default 
.
\newline 

\newline 
If 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
MH
\series default 
 match, the accompanying 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 lines are executed.
 Variables are replaced by their currently assigned value.
 Here the first 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
 will result in the following table to be generated:
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset 


\newline 
 The 
\family typewriter 
::gen
\family default 
 column is set to 
\series bold 
G_MX
\series default 
 after evaluation.
 Empty cells in 
\series bold 
MD
\series default 
 lines are filled with the value given by 
\series bold 
MX
\series default 
, if any.
\newline 

\newline 
Please see the contrib directory for commonly available connection macros
 (t.b.d.).
\layout Section

Generator statements
\layout Subsection

Hierachy Generator Operators
\layout Standard

Another powerfull feature of MIX are the generator statements.
 The generators are applied after initial tool setup and connection macro
 evaluation, first the hierachy generators, then the connection generators.
\newline 

\newline 
Generators are defined in the ::gen column.
 Basically three types are available:
\newline 

\layout Itemize

Constructor generators: $i(N..M)
\layout Itemize

Match generator: /match_expression/
\layout Itemize

Bounded match generator: $i(N..M),/match_expression/
\layout Standard

match_expression is like perl(1) regular expressions, but with some extensions
 and specials.
\newline 

\layout Subsubsection

Constructor Generator statement
\layout Standard

MIX takes the variable and the range definied in ::gen and evaluates the
 rest of the row for each value in the range.
 Currently only one variable is allowed and the range has to be of form
 (N..M).
\newline 

\newline 
A simple example illustrates the usage:
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/gen_it.jpg
	lyxscale 80
	scale 80
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
 will give ten instances from inst_1 to inst_10, each being a submodule
 of inst_a with each having a entity inst_1_e to inst_10_e, dito.
 for the configuration.
 Simple arithmetic can be applied to derive values from the run time parameter
 $i.
\newline 
Constructor's will yield new instances.
 An instance name has to be given in the ::inst column.
\newline 

\layout Subsubsection

Match generator
\layout Standard

For each instance defined up to now, match_expression is evaluated.
 If this yields true, the line is executed.
 Parts of the expression in parantheses are used to set the variables $1,
 $2, ...
 accordingly.
 See the perl regular expression man page perlre(1) for more details.
 This variables can be used in the other cells.
 Simple arithmetic is possible, e.g.
 $i + 1 or $1 * 2.
\newline 
A match generator will yield new instances only if the name in the ::inst
 column is set to a value different from the matching instance.
\newline 

\newline 
Example:
\newline 

\newline 
XXX t.b.d.
\newline 

\layout Subsubsection

Bounded match generator
\layout Standard

By adding a run variable and a range $i(N..M), match generators can be restricted
 to only apply if the variable $i is within the range.
 $i has to be defined in match_expression and will match any number.
\newline 

\newline 
In opposite to the constructor generator, MIX will not evaluate all possible
 values for $i, but only make sure $i stays within the bounds of the range.
\newline 

\newline 
Example:
\newline 

\newline 
XXX t.b.d.
\newline 

\layout Subsubsection

Advanced features of the match generators
\layout Standard

The match expression can contain references to all fields of the to match
 object with the
\newline 
::NAME_OF_COL=string(match):: reference.
\newline 

\newline 
E.g.
 the connection generator
\newline 

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/gen_2.jpg
	lyxscale 80
	scale 80
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset 


\newline 
 will wire all instances iom_.* having a property ::pin in the given range
 with a newly defined signal i_N_N+1.
 iom_foo with ::pin = 270 port serial_o will drive the signal i_270_271,
 the instance iom_bar with ::pin = 271 is connected to the signal i_270_271
 to it's port serial_i by the next line.
 for instance iom_foo only the first line matches, thus that module will
 net get a connection to serial_i by these generator lines.
\newline 

\newline 
A trainling :: can be omitted.
 If two propertied are to be matched, this will look like
\newline 

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hspace*{10mm}
\end_inset 

/::prop1=(.*)::::prop2=string(match?)/
\layout Subsubsection

Additional Information
\layout Standard

Match generators work the same way on the CONN sheets.
 By default the match expression will match against all defined instances,
 not connections.
\newline 
To make a match expression iterate over all connection, prefix the whole
 expression by the CONN: keyword.
\newline 

\newline 
Please have a look into the distributed howto.xls and the macro.xls in the
 test case directory t to see more examples.
\layout Section

IO sheet
\layout Standard

A third category of input specification is the IO sheet.
 The contents of the IO sheet is parsed and translated into instances of
 io cell blocks and pad cells and connections of the io logic with the design
 core logic.
\newline

\newline 
 Image 3: IO Cell and Pad Layout
\newline 
The IO sheet is a simple way to specify the connections of the IO cell to
 the design core logic.
 MIX will derive the connections of the DI(0..n), DO(0..n), PU(0..n), PD(0..n),
 EN(0..n) and the accompanying select lines.
 MIX will not add special purpose connections and the IO cell to Pad cell
 connections.
 This should be done by using the macro and generator statements in the
 CONN sheets.

Register-Master Sheet
\layout Standard

The Register-master sheet is one more category of input specification.
 It describes configuration register domains of devices.
 A register domain contains registers which in turn contain fields.
 The MIX tool creates 
\emph on 
views
\emph default 
 of a register domain, which is an implementation.
 Additionally, it can create 
\emph on 
reports
\emph default 
 which are used for documentation.
\newline 
There are also other in-house tools reading this format, which results in
 some legacy column data that is not used by MIX.

 The generated file has two sections,

 and 
\emph on

 which are enveloped by source-code pragmas (
\family typewriter

 If the output file is generated for the first time, it will be created
 from a template.
 If the output file already exists, it is read and only the head and body
 sections are replaced.
 This way, the user can make additions to the stimuli file.

Misc features
\layout Subsubsection

-delta mode
\layout Standard

In delta mode, MIX does not change output files, but reports the number
 of changes in the output files compared to a previous run.
 Extra sheets 
\family typewriter 
DIFF_CONN
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
DIFF_HIER
\family default 
 (and old versions of them) are added to the intermediate output file.
 The 
\family typewriter 
FOO.pld
\family default 
 internal output gets overwritten, though (if created).
 Messages are appended to 
\family typewriter 
mix_0.pl.out
\family default 

\newline 
If a new HDL-file needs to be created by the changes, 
\family typewriter 
-delta
\family default 
 mode is not be applied for that file, but it is generated as a new file.
 If you never have written a 
\family typewriter 
FOO-mixed.xls
\family default 
 intermediate output, no 
\family typewriter 
HIER
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
CONN
\family default 
 sheets are generated.
\newline 
By adding the following two lines to your configuration (e.g.
 
\family typewriter 
./mix.cfg
\family default 
), delta mode will be the default:
\newline 

\newline 

\family typewriter 
MIXCFG output.generate.delta 1

Intermediate Excel Sheet foo-mixed.xls
\layout Standard

MIX creates the 
\family typewriter 
foo-mixed.xls
\family default 
 intermediate file with the fully evaluated and expanded data from all input
 sources.
 The actual output format depends on the platform and kind of input data.
 An 
\family typewriter 
Excel
\family default 
 file is created on MS-Windows hosts, while in other cases a 
\family typewriter 
csv
\family default 
 format will be used.
\newline 
The file name name will be derived from the last input file name given on
 the command line with an inserted 
\family typewriter 
-mixed
\family default 
 before the file extension.
 
\newline 
Format of an intermediate xls sheet will be kept as is as long as the number
 and order of columns is unchanged.
\newline 
MIX saves three old versions of the generated 
\series bold 
HIER 
\series default 
and 
\series bold 
CONN 
\series default 
sheets.
 The worksheets names are rotated by a trailing _ and number, e.g 
\series bold 
HIER_0
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
HIER_1
\series default 
, ....
\newline 
Three sheets are created by default: 
\series bold 
HIER
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
CONN
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
CONF
\series default 
.
\newline 
By using various configuration parameters you can change that, however:
 
\newline 

\newline 
'

 (I,O,IO,C,P,G, ...) is mapped to 
\family typewriter 
%TM_(I|O|IO|...)%
\family default 
.
 These macros are predefined to map back to the original mode, if you run
 the created CONN sheet through MIX again.
\layout Subsubsection

Output Redirection
\layout Standard

MIX writes all output into the current working directory.
 By using the
\newline 

\family typewriter 
-dir DIRECTORY
\family default 

\newline 
option, you can set the output directory for all intermediate, internal
 and HDL files to 
\family typewriter 
DIRECTORY
\family default 
.
 Absolute path names defined by other options (e.g.
 -out) are not changed, though.
 If 
\family typewriter 
DIRECTORY
\family default 
 does not exist, it will be created.
 To have separate output directories, use the 
\family typewriter 
mix.cfg
\family default 
 file:
\newline 

\family typewriter 
MIXCFG output.path HDLDIRS
\family default 

\newline 

\family typewriter 
MIXCFG internal.path MIXINTERNAL
\family default 

\newline 

\family typewriter 
MIXCFG intermediate MIXINTERMEDIATE
\family default 

\newline 
writes internal, intermediate and HDL files to the given pathes.
 All directories have to exist and will not be created.

Convert ExCEL to SXC and CVS
\layout Standard
\noindent 
MIX comes with a command line Excel to CSV converter tool:
\layout Standard
\noindent 
Usage for UNIX is like:
\layout Standard
\noindent 

\family typewriter 
$ module load perl mix
\layout Standard
\noindent 

\family typewriter 
$ xls2csv -csv foo[.xls] bar[.xls] [bar2.xls ...]
\layout Standard
\noindent 
This will convert all sheets in foo.xls to foo.csv, bar.xls to bar.csv and so
 on.
 As cvs only has one sheet, the different input sheets will be seperated
 by ":=:=:=>" followed by the ExCEL sheet name.
 Even the first and maybe only sheet will be marked by such a line.
 Now supports the selection of rows and/or columns (see -column / -row option)
\layout Standard
