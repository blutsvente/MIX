
To build the pdf output use: pdflatex <filename> 
or simply type: make

The use of jpeg's causes to build of pdf-files, to generate a dvi you would have
to convert each jpeg file to postscript format.


Warning: 
cvs adds special keywords for verification this causes damage of binary files!

To check in a binary file use:

      $ cvs add -kb -m"A test file" <file2permit>
      $ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" <file2permit>


To fix this problem in already checked in files use:

      $ cvs admin -kb <file2change>
      $ cvs update -A <file2change>
      # For non-unix systems:
      # Copy in a good copy of the file from outside CVS
      $ cvs commit -m "make it binary" <file2change>


The used -k options keeps the used mode -b (binary) for the given file.
