>>title: MIX/1.7 release 20070306: IF/ELSE, emumux, ::udc

Hallo,

i just installed a new version of the MIX tool.

It comes with some extra features and an improved documentation.
It has passed all of the MIX internal regression tests.

News:

1. IF/ELSIF/ELSE generator bundling

Consecutive generators (the ::gen  /inst_(\w+)/ ...) can be bundled
with IF/ELSIF/ELSE prefix now. Simply write two or more consecutive
generators and prepend them with ELSIF and ELSE. Then the ELSIF/ELSE
pathes will get executed only if the predecessor lines did not match.

Caveat: positional parameters ($1, ...) are only available locally.

2. Emumux insertion.

Setting the parameter "output.generate.emumux.modules" to a non empty
string (comma seperated list or perl regular expression) will insert
emulation multiplexers into the input signal pathes of all instances
listed or matching the regular expression.

$ mix -conf output.generate.emumux.modules='.*'
	--> insert emulation multiplexer for all modules
$ mix -conf output.generate.emumux.modules=module_a,module_b,module_c
	--> insert emulation multiplexers for module_a, module_b and module_c.

3. ::udc insertion for instantiations

User defined code can be inserted before (%PINS%) and after (%AINS%)
a module instantiation. See the description for ::udc in the documentation.

Example:
::udc
/%PINS%/udc to go pre instantiation
/%AINS%/udc to be appended to instantiation

4. HDL output filenames will be all lowercase now.

By default output filenames will be lowercase (output.casefilename = lc)

Finally:

To use this version, use
$ module load mix/1.7
For migration, consider running the new version with the delta mode on top
of the results from mix/1.6. Changes will be detected easily in *.diff files
and reported in mix.log.
