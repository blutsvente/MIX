MIX HOWTO and FAQ

>>title: Avoid that IO/inout signals get wired to the toplevel

By default MIX wires all I, O and IO signals to the top-level.
Use I and O only for signals, that should be wired to the top-level
anyway. Otherwise use S or leave the ::mode empty, MIX will detect the
right mode automatically by consulting the ::in and ::out columns.

The situation is different for inout signals. To tell MIX a signal should
be of mode inout, you need to pit IO in the ::mode column. However, that
automatically will wire that signal as inout port at the toplevel module.

To avoid that, list the signal name in the configuration key
output.generate.xinout (comma seperated list, perl regular expression allowed).

To switch off the automatic wiring to the top-level globally, set the
output.generate.inout variable to the empty string (defaults to "mode").

>>title: Known signal mode keys

Allowed values for the  ::mode column are:
 
	B     buffer (implemented only partially)
	S     signal (default; might be omitted)
	IO    inout (with top level connection)
	I     in (wire to top level)
	O     out (wire to top level)
	G     generic (defining a generic and assign a default)
	P     parameter (set the actual value for a generic)
	C     constant (might be omitted, MIX detects all kind of constants in the
          ::out column and automtically set C then).

See the test case files "constant.xls" and "generics.xls" for examples for generics
and constants.
