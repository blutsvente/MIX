Application Note / TOC

- Basic wiring:

- Macro definitions and evaluation

- Command line switches:
(from mix_0.pl):

#
#TODO: Add that to application note
# -out OUTPUTFILE.ext       defines output filename and type
# -outenty OUT-e.vhd        filename for entity. If argument is ENTY[NAME], each entity
#                                   will be written into a file calles entityname-e.vhd
# -top TOPCELL                 use TOPCELL as top. Default is TESTBENCH or daughter of TESTBENCH
# -adump                        dump internal data in ASCII format, too (debugging, use with small data set).
# -variant
# -conf key.key.key=value Overwrite $EH{key}{key}{key} with value
# -listconf                       Print out all available/predefined configurations options
# -sheet SHEET=MATCH     SHEET can be one of "hier", "conn", "vi2c"
#


# Add your options here ....

- All output will be logged to mix_0.out in cwd.

- Usage of generics and parameters:

- Usage of low and high busses:

- Usage of constants
