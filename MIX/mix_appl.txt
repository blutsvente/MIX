Application Note / TOC

- Basic wiring:

- Macro definitions and evaluation:
  MH: Macro header: needs to match against the MX line ($X defines variables)
  MD: Body of macro. Will be inserted after variable replacement.
  MX: Triggers macro expansion. Will be matched against all MH lines known.
  Defines variable values.

- Generator statements, extended match operators:

- Command line switches:
(from mix_0.pl):

#
#TODO: Add that to application note
# -out OUTPUTFILE.ext       defines output filename and type
# -outenty OUT-e.vhd        filename for entity. If argument is ENTY[NAME], each entity
#                                   will be written into a file calles entityname-e.vhd
# -top TOPCELL                 use TOPCELL as top. Default is TESTBENCH or daughter of TESTBENCH
# -adump                        dump internal data in ASCII format, too (debugging, use with small data set).
# -variant
# -conf key.key.key=value Overwrite $EH{key}{key}{key} with value
# -listconf                       Print out all available/predefined configurations options
# -sheet SHEET=MATCH     SHEET can be one of "hier", "conn", "vi2c"
#


# Add your options here ....

- All output will be logged to mix_0.out in cwd.

- Usage of generics and parameters:

- Usage of low and high busses:

- Usage of constants

- Not allowed are:

- Configuration switches:

- Signal names have to be unique (but can be defined with %::column% macros)

- Text proceesing capabilites:
    Use %::column% marker will  be replaced by content of this column will processing.

- Predefined text markers are:
    %HIGH%
    %LOW%
    %HIGH_BUS%
    %LOW_BUS%
    %TOP%

- Format of intermediate xls sheet will be kept as is.

- Output files will be generated in current directory if not stated otherwise.

- Runtime configuration is influenced by (increasing precedence):
    built-in default values
    mix.cfg file (if found in current directory). Format is:
        MIXCFG name.of.conf value
    CONF sheet found in input xls files
    command line switch -conf name.of.conf=value

- If no ::arch column is given, architecture will default to "rtl"
    (configuration hier.field.::arch.[3] = rtl; cannot be changed globally)

- UNIX/MS-Win Issues:

-- Use "recode pc..lat1 *.vhd" for easy and fast DOS2UNIX converter
    (module load freeware)
