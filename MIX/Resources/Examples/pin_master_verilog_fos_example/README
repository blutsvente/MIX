# MIX Flow
#
# first off all the mix binary has to be activated
# on the munich site this is done like this:
#

module load mix/1.9

# second:
# start MIX like this
# -vinc global_project.i -> handles a include file (example inside the LP-blue-pin-list.xls)
# -nodelta               -> avoids incremental generation
# *pin-list.xls          -> provide the module connection sheets
# LP-HIER.xls            -> provide the design hierarchy sheet

rm mix.log
mix -vinc global_project.i -nodelta *pin-list.xls LP-HIER.xls

# thats all


# Remarks
i#
# 1) a mix.cfg is needed for setup of mix
#
# 2) the names of the sheets in excel is essential:
#       HIER    -> is needed at least once, there can be more 
#       CONN_.* -> needed as many leaf modules should be connected
#                  not needed for hierarchy connection levels like core or top
#                  HIER, CONN_.* can be placed in one single xls document with many sheets
#
# 3) /tools/mix/1.9/doc/MIX_Userreference.pdf -> documentation
