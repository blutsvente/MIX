Log::Agent - logging agent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Log::Agent;            # in all reusable components
 logerr "error";
 logtrc "notice:12", "notice that" if ...;
 logdie "log and die";

 use Log::Agent;            # in application's main
 logconfig(-prefix => $0);  # simplest, uses default driver

 use Log::Agent;                    # another more complex example
 require Log::Agent::Driver::File;  # logging made to file
 logconfig(-driver =>
     Log::Agent::Driver::File->make(
         -prefix      => $0,
         -showpid     => 1,
         -channels    => {
             'error'  => "$0.err",
             'output' => "$0.out",
             'debug'  => "$0.dbg",
         },
     )
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Log::Agent> module provides an abstract layer for logging and
tracing, which is independant from the actual method used to physically
perform those activities. It acts as an agent (hence the name) that
collects the requests and delegates processing to a sublayer: the
logging driver.

The C<Log::Agent> module is meant to be used in all reusable components,
since they cannot know in advance how the application which ends up using
them will perform its logging activities: either by emitting messages
on stdout and errors on stderr, or by directing messages to logfiles,
or by using syslog(3).

The logging interface is common for all the logging drivers, and is
therefore the result of a compromise between many logging schemes: any
information given at this level must be either handled by all drivers,
or may be ignored depending on the application's final choice.

WARNING: THIS INTERFACE IS STILL SOMEWHAT ALPHA AND COULD STILL CHANGE
DEPENDING ON THE FEEDBACK I SHALL GET FROM USERS AND FROM MY OWN
EXPERIENCE USING IT, WITHOUT ANY BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ASSURANCE.

=head1 PRIORITIES AND LEVEL

The C<Log::Agent> module can use both priorities (as defined by
syslog(3)) or logging levels, or either, in which case there is
an implicit computation of the missing item (i.e. the level 4, for
instance, corresponds to the "warning" priority, and vice-versa).
See L<Log::Agent::Priorities> for more details.

A logging level is defined as being a threshold: any level lesser than
or equal to that threshold will be logged.

At the C<Log::Agent> level, it is possible to define a trace level and
a debug level. Only the messages below those levels (inclusive) will be
handed out to the underlying driver for logging. They are used by the
logtrc() and logdbg() routines, respectively.

=head1 CHANNELS

The C<Log::Agent> class defines three logging channels, which are
C<error>, C<output> and C<debug>. Depending on the driver used for
logging, those channels are ignored (typically with syslog()) or may
be implicitely defined (default logging, i.e. the one achieved by the
C<Log::Agent::Driver::Default> driver, remaps C<error> and C<debug>
to stderr, C<output> to stdout).

=head1 INTERFACE

Anywhere a I<message> is expected, it can be a single string, or a
printf()-like format string followed by the required arguments. The
special macro C<%m> is handled directly by C<Log::Agent> and is replaced
by the string version of $!, which is the last error message returned
by the last failing system call.

B<NOTE>: There should not be any trailing "\n" in the I<message> strings,
nor any embededed one, although this is not enforced. Remember that
the main purpose of C<Log::Agent> is to specify logging messages in a
standard way!  Therefore, most of the time, a "should" should be read as
"must" and "should not" as "must not", which is the strongest interdiction
form available in English, as far as I know.

Here are valid I<message> examples:

    "started since $time"
    "started since %s", $time
    "fork: %m"

The follwing logging interface is made available to modules:

=over 4

=item logdbg I<priority>, I<message>

Debug logging of I<message> to the C<debug> channel.

You may specify any priority you want, i.e.  a C<debug> priority is
not enforced here. You may even specify C<"notice:4"> if you wish,
to have the message logged if the debug level is set to 4 or less.
If handed over to syslog(3), the message will nonetheless be logged at
the C<notice> priority.

=item logtrc I<priority>, I<message>

Trace logging of I<message> to the C<output> channel.

Like logdbg() above, you are not restricted to the C<info> priority. This
routine checks the logging level (either explicit as in C<"info:14">
or implicit as in C<"notice">) against the trace level.

=item logsay I<message>

Log the message at the C<notice> priority to the C<output> channel.
The logging always takes place under the default C<-trace> settings, but
only if the routine is called, naturally.  This means you can still say:

    logsay "some trace message" if $verbose;

and control whether the message is emitted by using some external
configuration for your module (e.g. by adding a -verbose flag to the
creation routine of your class).

=item logwarn I<message>

Log a warning message at the C<warning> priority to the C<error> channel.

=item logcarp I<message>

Same as logwarn(), but issues a Carp::carp(3) call instead, which will
warn from the perspective of the routine's caller.

=item logerr I<message>

Log an error message at the C<error> priority to the C<error> channel.

=item logdie I<message>

Log a fatal message at the C<critical> priority to the C<error> channel,
and then dies.

=item logconfess I<message>

Same as logdie(), but issues a Carp::confess(3) call instead.  It is
possible to configure the C<Log::Agent> module via the C<-confess>
switch to automatically redirect a logdie() to logconfess(), which is
invaluable during unit testing.

=item logcroak I<message>

Same as logdie(), but issues a Carp::croak(3) call instead.  It is
possible to configure the C<Log::Agent> module via the C<-confess>
switch to automatically redirect a logcroak() to logconfess(), which is
invaluable during unit testing.

=item Log::Agent::inited

Returns true when C<Log::Agent> was initialized, either explicitely via
a logconfig() or implicitely via any logxxx() call.

=back

Modules sometimes wish to report errors from the perspective of their
caller's caller, not really their caller.  The following interface is
therefore provided:

=over 4

=item logxcarp I<offset>, I<message>

Same a logcarp(), but with an additional offset to be applied on the
stack.  To warn one level above your caller, set it to 1.

=item logxcroak I<offset>, I<message>

Same a logcroak(), but with an additional offset to be applied on the
stack.  To report an error one level above your caller, set it to 1.

=back

For applications that wish to implement a debug layer on top of
C<Log::Agent>, the following routine is provided.  Note that it is not
imported by default, i.e. it needs to be explicitely mentionned at C<use>
time, since it is not meant to be used directly under regular usage.

=over 4

=item logwrite I<channel>, I<priority>, I<message>

Unconditionally write the I<message> at the given I<priority> on I<channel>.
The channel can be one of C<debug>, C<error> or C<output>.

=back

At the application level, one needs to commit once and for all about the
logging scheme to be used. This is done thanks to the logconfig() routine
which takes the following switches, in alphabetical order:

=over 4

=item C<-caller> => [ I<parameters> ]

Request that caller information (relative to the logxxx() call) be part
of the log message. The given I<parameters> are handed off to the
creation routine of C<Log::Agent::Tag::Caller> and are documented there.

I usually say something like:

 -caller => [ -display => '($sub/$line)', -postfix => 1 ]

which I find informative enough. On occasion, I found myself using more
complex sequences.  See L<Log::Agent::Tag::Caller>.

=item C<-confess> => I<flag>

When true, all logdie() calls will be automatically masqueraded as
logconfess().

=item C<-debug> => I<priority or level>

Sets the priority threshold (can be expressed as a string or a number, the
string being mapped to a logging level as described above in
B<PRIORITIES AND LEVEL>) for logdbg() calls.

Calls tagged with a level less than or equal to the given threshold will
pass through, others will return prematurely without logging anything.

=item C<-driver> => I<driver_object>

This switch defines the driver object to be used, which must be an heir of
the C<Log::Agent::Driver> class. See L<Log::Agent::Driver(3)> for a list
of the available drivers.

=item C<-level> => I<priority or level>

Specifies both C<-debug> and C<-trace> levels at the same time, to a
common value.

=item C<-prefix> => I<name>

Defines the application name which will be pre-pended to all messages,
followed by C<": "> (a colon and a space). Using this switch alone will
configure the default driver to use that prefix (stripped down to its
basename component).

When a driver object is used, the C<-prefix> switch is kept at the
C<Log::Agent> level only and is not passed to the driver: it is up to
the driver's creation routine to request the C<-prefix>. Having this
information in Log::Agent enables the module to die on critical errors
with that error prefix, since it cannot rely on the logging driver for
that, obviously.

=item C<-priority> => [ I<parameters> ]

Request that message priority information be part of the log message.
The given I<parameters> are handed off to the
creation routine of C<Log::Agent::Tag::Priority> and are documented there.

I usually say something like:

	-priority => [ -display => '[$priority]' ]

which will display the whole priority name at the beginning of the messages,
e.g. "[warning]" for a logwarn() or "[error]" for logerr().
See L<Log::Agent::Tag::Priority> and L<Log::Agent::Priorities>.

B<NOTE>: Using C<-priority> does not prevent the C<-duperr> flag of
the file driver to also add its own hardwired prefixing in front of
duplicated error messages.  The two options act at a different level.

=item C<-tags> => [ I<list of C<Log::Agent::Tag> objects> ]

Specifies user-defined tags to be added to each message.  The objects
given here must inherit from C<Log::Agent::Tag> and conform to its
interface.  See L<Log::Agent::Tag> for details.

At runtime, well after logconfig() was issued, it may be desirable to
add (or remove) a user tag.  Use the C<logtags()> routine for this purpose,
and iteract directly with the tag list object.

For instance, a web module might wish to tag all the messages with a
session ID, information that might not have been available by the time
logconfig() was issued.

=item C<-trace> => I<priority or level>

Same a C<-debug> but applies to logsay(), logwarn(), logerr() and logtrc().

When unspecified, C<Log::Agent> runs at the "notice" level.

=back

Additional routines, not exported by default, are:

=over 4

=item logtags

Returns a C<Log::Agent::Tag_List> object, which holds all user-defined
tags that are to be added to each log message.

The initial list of tags is normally supplied by the application at
logconfig() time, via the C<-tags> argument.  To add or remove tags after
configuration time, one needs direct access to the tag list, obtained via
this routine.  See L<Log::Agent::Tag_List> for the operations that can be
performed.

=back

=head1 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

The following limitations exist in this early version. They might be
addressed in future versions if they are perceived as annoying limitatons
instead of being just documented ones. :-)

=over 4

=item *

A module which calls logdie() may have its die trapped if called from
within an eval(), but unfortunately, the value of $@ is unpredictable:
it may be prefixed or not depending on the driver used. This is harder to
fix as one might think of at first glance.

=item *

Some drivers lack customization and hardwire a few things that come
from my personal taste, like the prefixing done when I<duperr> is set
in Log::Agent::Driver::File, or the fact that the C<debug> and C<stderr>
channels are merged as one in the Log::Agent::Driver::Default driver.

=item *

When using logcroak() or logconfess(), the place where the call was
made can still be visible when -caller is used, since the addition
of the caller information to the message is done before calling the
logging driver.  Is this a problem?
