=head1 NAME

Log::Agent::Message - a log message

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 require Log::Agent::Message;

 my $msg = Log::Agent::Message->make("string");
 $msg->prepend("string");
 $msg->append("string");
 my $copy = $msg->clone;

 print "Message is $msg\n";     # overloaded stringification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Log::Agent::Message class represents an original log message
(a string) to which one may prepend or append other strings, but with
the special property that prepended strings aggregate themselves
in FIFO order, whilst appended strings aggregate themselves in LIFO
order, which is counter-intuitive at first sight.

In plain words, this means that the last routine that prepends something
to the message will get its prepended string right next to the original
string, regardless of what could have been prepended already. The behaviour
is symetric for appending.

=head1 INTERFACE

The following routines are available:

=over 4

=item append($str)

Append suppled string $str to the original string (given at creation
time), at the head of all existing appended strings.

=item append_last($str)

Append suppled string $str to the original string (given at creation
time), at the tail of all existing appended strings.

=item clone

Clone the message. This is not a shallow clone, because the list of
prepended and appended strings is recreated. However it is not a deep
clone, because the items held in those lists are merely copied (this would
matter only when other objects with overloaded stringification routines
were supplied to prepend() and append(), which is not the case today in
the basic Log::Agent framework).

=item make($string)

This is the creation routine.

=item prepend($str)

Prepend supplied string $str to the original string (given at creation
time), at the tail of all existing prepended strings.

=item prepend_first($str)

Prepend supplied string $str to the original string (given at creation
time), at the head of all existing prepended strings.

=item stringify

This is the overloaded "" operator, which returns the complete string
composed of all the prepended strings, the original string, and all
the appended strings.
