=head1 NAME

Log::Agent::Tag::Caller - formats caller information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 Not intended to be used directly
 Inherits from Log::Agent::Tag.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class handles caller information for Log::Agent services and is not
meant to be used directly.

This manpage therefore only documents the creation routine parameters
that can be specified at the Log::Agent level via the C<-caller> switch
in the logconfig() routine.

=head1 CALLER INFORMATION ENTITIES

This class knows about four entities: I<package>, I<filename>, I<line>
and I<subroutine>, which are to be understood within the context of the
Log::Agent routine being called (e.g. a logwarn() routine), namely:

=over 4

=item package

This is the package name where the call to the logwarn() routine was made.
It can be specified as "pack" for short, or spelled out completely.

=item filename

This is the file where the call to the logwarn() routine was made.
It can be specified as "file" for short, or spelled out completely.

=item line

This is the line number where the call to the logwarn() routine was made,
in file I<filename>. The name is short enough to be spelled out completely.

=item subroutine

This is the subroutine where the call to the logwarn() routine was made.
If the call is made outside a subroutine, this will be empty.
The name is long enough to warrant the "sub" abbreviation if you don't wish
to spell it out fully.

=back

=head1 CREATION ROUTINE PARAMETERS

The purpose of those parameters is to define how caller information entities
(as defined by the previous section) will be formatted within the log message.

=over 4

=item C<-display> => I<string>

Specifies a string with minimal variable substitution: only the caller
information entities specified above, or their abbreviation, will be
interpolated. For instance:

	-display => '($package::$sub/$line)'

Don't forget to use simple quotes to avoid having Perl interpolate those
as variables, or escape their leading C<$> sign otherwise. Using this
convention was deemed to more readable (and natural in Perl)
than SGML entities such as "&pack;".

Using this switch supersedes the C<-info> and C<-format> switches.

=item C<-format> => I<printf format>

Formatting instructions for the caller information entities
listed by the C<-info> switch. For instance:

    -format => "%s:%4d"

if you have specified two entities in C<-info>.

The special formatting macro C<%a> stands for all the entities specified
by C<-info> and is rendered by a string where values are separated by ":".

=item C<-info> => I<"space separated list of parameters">

Specifies a list of caller information entities that are to be formated
using the C<-format> specification. For instance:

	-info => "pack sub line"

would only report those three entites.

=item C<-postfix> => I<flag>

Whether the string resulting from the formatting of the caller information
entities should be appended to the regular log message or not
(i.e. prepended, which is the default).

=item C<-separator> => I<string>

The separation string between the tag and the log message.
A single space by default.
