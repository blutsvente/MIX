MIX - Micronas Interconnect Expander
------------------------------------
File under: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) or Electronic System-Level Design (ESL)

MIX is a methodology and tool to generate hardware descriptions, low-level driver software, verification code and documentation out of a single source specification. In contrast to most ESL (electronic system level design) tools, this approach focuses on structural specification, like hierarchy, interconnect, I/Os and configuration registers instead of synthesizing a functional specification (though the user can always insert arbitrary HDL code). Due to automatic code generation, consistency between specification and design is guaranteed and error-prone manual transformations can be avoided.

A table-based specification format was chosen to enable efficient data entry and review. Lately, the Spirit consortiums IP-XACT input/output format for register specifications has been added. It is also possible to access the code generation functions through a Perl API which is useful where a table-based entry format contains too much redundancy due to its flat data representation.
